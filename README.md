# gumtree-to-sms


## Introduction ##
-------------

A Python & Selenium script to scrape Gumtree searches for phone number and name, and send customized SMS via Textmarketer.co.uk cheap API.


#### Requirements ####
-------------

python3.6
selenium
bs4
textmarketer.co.uk API keys


## Gumtree To SMS ##
-------------

Replace:

- path_to_chromium
- path_to_phantom_js
- YOUR_API_KEY
- YOUR_API_PWD
- YOUR_NAME

Note: Was used to get property ads. You might want to change the query.

Note: It's a bit messy, it doesn't all work together. I need to fix the link between the scraper and the SMS API.

### gumphone.py ###
-------------

Using Selenium:
- Iterate through each page of the search query and scrape all the ads
- Crawl to each individual ads, reveal and scrape the phone number and name

### smsapi.py ###
-------------

Using Textmarketer API:
- Send personalized SMS using the name

### send.py and main.py ###
-------------

These need to be fixed. 
Working: - send.py -> input name_list and phone_list scraped from gumphone.py and run to send SMSs.
